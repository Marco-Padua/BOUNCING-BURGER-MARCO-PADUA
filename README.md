My program displays a burger image with my name on it moving around in a window. The window measures 800x600 pixels and has a white background.

The burger starts in one area and moves diagonally. When it reaches the window's edges, it bounces in the opposite direction. To make it more interesting, my name changes color with each bounce.Â I can use the spacebar to stop and resume the animation.
